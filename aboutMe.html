                                     <h2> Writer </h2>
                                       <p>Back at BCIT I was an Associate Editor of <b><a href="http://www.linkbcit.ca/author/jarell-alvarez/">Link BCIT Magazine</a></b> and was responsible for collaboratively creating an engaging and relevant student publication. Responsibilities also included writing out articles, recruiting contributors, guiding them and editing their work. I’ve also written a few <b><a href="https://medium.com/@jarell.alvarez">Medium articles</a></b> and something I'll pursue again. </p>

                                     <h2>  Board Game Nerd  </h2>
                                       <p>Large or tiny boxes of joy that live on my shelves singing it's sirens calls, my collection waits impatiently to be woken up in slumber. Recently I've begun my conquest on the biggest, baddest, funnest collection around and will play these boxes of joy's during lunch to appease my card board rulers. Marie Kondo would approve.</p>

                                     <h2>   Cooking Nerd  </h2>
                                       <p>I love testing recipes for weekly meal prep and have a knack for staying late on my phone watching how to videos on different meals. I love staying in the kitchen, creating my own yogurt and granola and I have a mighty good Pad Thai recipe. </p>

                                     <h2>   1:1 Mentoring  </h2>
                                       <p>I’ve been mentoring since 2018 and would love to meet up with you if you have any questions regarding after post-secondary development or any design related questions you might have. I also love to teach Photoshop and Sketch to fellow peers. </p>

From travel, graduation and family portraits to owning my own headshot business and running Convertus' Humans of Convertus photo series, there’s never a moment finer than one captured through a lens.  </p>
